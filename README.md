# SnakeArcade
Simple Snake arcade 2D game with levels.

The above code was created using typescript and can be run by using the vscode "Go Live" or WAMP on local.
for above project typescript command has been used (tsc) to create a single js compiled file. after this file is created we can bundle it and we can add to cordova for creating apk or add it to website bundle and link it to a div where the game can be loaded easily.

Note:- Snake folder is the compiled file ( not minified and encrypt ), files in snake folder are the deployable file for website that can be deployed and linked to the index file or can be linked to a div itself with the index file.
